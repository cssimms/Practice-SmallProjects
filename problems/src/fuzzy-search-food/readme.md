## Fuzzy Search field for foods (originally attempted 2021 for Mill)

#### PART 1: 
implement a fuzzy search for matching foods to their synonyms, and whether they are
 compostable
  ex: tomatoes: yes, beef: no, cow: no, avocado: yes

  Search field should have the following requirements: 
    search button and input field should be touching in the middle
    rounded corners on the outside, but not where they are touching
    input should be taller than default
    input should be 2x wide as button
    button should be light blue

#### PART 2: once we get that working we'll try to add in parts of each food
  ex: avocado -> pit: no, fruit: yes, skin: yes
      peach -> pit: no, fruit: yes, skin: yes
