# Collection of Small Projects

This is a collection of unrelated code that I'd like to save for future review. It includes unfinished projects, half-baked ideas, and serves as a general practice area for things.

As such, each top level directory should be responsible for it's own packages, runtime env, etc. Nothing should be run from the top level except for maybe some configuration defaults.

Probably the more interesting directory is `/problems`, where I'm storing completed problems for practice later. These are generally from interviews I've done, but I won't site which companies gave which problems.
